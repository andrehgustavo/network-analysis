 In this exercise we created a database in graph format referring to the Brazilian air network. The database included all Brazilian airports with the following metadata: 
 - a) airport name;
 - b) city; 
 - c) state;
 - d) airport code;
 - e) latitude; 
 - f) longitude.

 In our graph, two airports are connected if there is a flight departing or arriving from the respective airports.
